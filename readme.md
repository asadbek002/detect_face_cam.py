## FACE DETECTION
Face Detection programm using OpenCV
## Description
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. it's perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera..
